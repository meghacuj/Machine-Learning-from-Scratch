Linear Regression using OLS method: The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is an algorithm used in linear regression analysis.where,we obtain a single slope (m) and a single intercept (b). These coefficients describe the best-fit line through the data, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the line i,e Cost/Loss function and we ultimately get a best fit line. For Simple Linear Regression, we get one "m" and one intercept "b", whereas, in multiple linear Regression, we get one slope corresponding to each features but only one intercept.
